# Insurance - Hibernate & MVC
This project is a insurance system developed using Java and Hibernate. It supports two different usage structures:

1. **Core Hibernate usage**: Direct data operations (create, update, delete) via `EntityManager`.
2. **MVC version**: A user interface built with a layered architecture following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
